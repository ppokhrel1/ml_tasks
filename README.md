This repo contains the code samples for the uses of RAGs and LLMs. 

1) AskArXiv - RAG which scrapes data from ARXIV and generates embeddings. The embeddings are then used in RAG for search to find information relevant to the prompt.

2) CollabCompass - Call instagram and tiktok api, use data and generate embeddings for RAGs. Once the best influencer is identified, generate prompt to message the influencer. Useful for brands to contact content creators for advertising.
